# CMIP6 regridding pipelines

The pipelines here are used for regridding large chunks of SNAP's production CMIP6 data. Currently, there are three flows: 
* `regrid-cmip6`: base flow for regridding our CMIP6 data. It may be called on its own, but it is more likely to be called as part of one of the following flows. 
* `regrid-cmip6-common`: flow for producing our production "common" / 100km CMIP6 dataset
* `regrid-cmip6-4km`: flow for regridding CMIP6 data to a 4km EPSG: 3338 grid. Likely only used as part of a downscaling flow.

The main `regrid-cmip6` flow regrids the raw CMIP6 outputs mirrored from the [Earth System Grid Federation](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) onto a common spatial grid, including extent, file structure (how data are named and grouped into files) and calendar (365-day, with no leap years), determined by some target grid file. For the `regrid-cmip6-common` flow, we use the same grid used by NCAR-CESM2, TaiESM1, and NorESM2-MM, as this was the most common grid among the models in SNAP's 12-model ensemble (not including E3SM-* models), and this ~100km resolution falls in the middle among the models. This grid is a "finite-volume grid with 0.9x1.25 degree lat/lon resolution" (note, the actual latitude resolution in the files is ~0.94Â°).

## Production config files

You can use the following config files to do "production runs" of the regridding pipeline. 
In the prefect flow page, do a "custom" run, and copy the contents of the file into the "JSON" box. Make sure to change the `ssh_private_key_path` to your own key. 

`v1_1_config.json` - This is the "V1" variables from our scoping doc, but arguably the most useful variables from that batch - air temperature, precip, and wind. 
`v1_2_config.json` - These are the remaining "V1" variables from our scoping doc. Includes wind components, radiation variables, etc.
