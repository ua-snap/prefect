# CMIP6 regridding pipeline

The `regrid_cmip6` flow is used for generating SNAP's production CMIP6 dataset. This is simply standardizing all raw CMIP6 outputs mirrored from the [Earth System Grid Federation](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) onto a common spatial grid, including file structure (how data are named and grouped into files) and calendar (365-day, with no leap years). We use the same grid used by NCAR-CESM2, TaiESM1, and NorESM2-MM, as this was the most common grid among the models in SNAP's 12-model ensemble. This grid is a "finite-volume grid with 0.9x1.25 degree lat/lon resolution" (note, the actual latitude resolution in the files is ~0.94Â°).

Below is a list of all possible variables that could be included in the a run of the regridding pipeline, for reference:
