# CMIP6 regridding pipelines

The pipelines here are used for regridding large chunks of SNAP's production CMIP6 data. Currently, there are three flows: 
* `regrid-cmip6`: base flow for regridding our CMIP6 data. It may be called on its own, but it is more likely to be called as part of one of the following flows. 
* `regrid-cmip6-common`: flow for producing our production "common" / 100km CMIP6 dataset
* `regrid-cmip6-4km`: flow for regridding CMIP6 data to a 4km EPSG: 3338 grid. Likely only used as part of a downscaling flow.

The main `regrid-cmip6` flow regrids the raw CMIP6 outputs mirrored from the [Earth System Grid Federation](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) onto a common spatial grid, including extent, file structure (how data are named and grouped into files) and calendar (365-day, with no leap years), determined by some target grid file. For the `regrid-cmip6-common` flow, we use the same grid used by NCAR-CESM2, TaiESM1, and NorESM2-MM, as this was the most common grid among the models in SNAP's 12-model ensemble (not including E3SM-* models), and this ~100km resolution falls in the middle among the models. This grid is a "finite-volume grid with 0.9x1.25 degree lat/lon resolution" (note, the actual latitude resolution in the files is ~0.94Â°).
